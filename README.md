# Uncommon Python Error: ZeroDivisionError

This repository demonstrates an example of an uncommon error in Python: the `ZeroDivisionError`.  The code attempts to divide by zero, which results in this specific exception.

The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.py` file provides a solution to handle the potential `ZeroDivisionError` using exception handling.

This example highlights the importance of input validation and error handling in robust Python programming.  Always anticipate potential exceptions and implement appropriate measures to prevent program crashes.
